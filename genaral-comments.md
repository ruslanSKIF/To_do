## General requirements
- use `npm init` to make a project skeleton;
- add README.MD file that contains info about your application;
- add scripts to `package.json` (created by npm once you init your app) that allow to run and check how your application works. To serve static files you can use any libs (ex. https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve);
- dist folder must be in .gitignore
